Users: How many times have we set clear intentions like the following: This year I am going to go to the gym regularly! This year onwards I am going to run regularly! From now on, fitness and eating healthy is going to be my top-most priority only to realize two weeks later (for 92% of us at least) we have fallen back to our old ways. Fitness is 'BORING' and that is one of the largest reasons why most of us drop out of fitness habits. Users are rarely hooked on to the same fitness programs. It is not easy to come up with unique programs for everyone, especially not at a low cost. Brands: Brands have always been looking for ways to engage both internal and external users with campaigns that can put them in the positive mindspace of their users. Health related events have a very positive angle to it, however it has NOT been easy to create, coordinate, market and get reports around these from one single platform.\",\r\n        solution: \"TELO - an events-based fitness tracking app for all of us! 'Events' however have the ability to keep things light, fun and engaging, especially when there is the possibility of it being a social and community driven phenomenon. Enter TELO, a mobile app where users can discover, register, set-reminders, practice/train, participate/track, share and brag achievements and more importantly - Build a Tribe around their fitness habits! Imagine a day where you have grown fit, but also have built a community around your friends circle, family, school, college, social media or anywhere you find your tribe. After all, we humans are all social animals!\",\r\n        product: \"TELO is meant to be a platform app where users can discover fun and engaging fitness based events around them. Besides that they would have the ability to: Register for free/paid events; Set reminders for the same on their calendar; Train for events if they choose to; Participate in group events hosted in and around their localities; Track the fitness events like Runs, Walks and Jogs with metrics like - distance, pace/speed, elevation, calories burnt, steps covered at various intervals - daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and all time; Track your own achievements and if necessary compare yourself with others in your community/groups to better your performance; Track their fitness activities with smart tracking device integrations like Apple Watch, FitBit, Google Wear etc. (coming soon); Fun audio tracks (gamified story format) that help you achieve your running and other fitness goals that act like guides; Share achievements and build a community of like minded people within your community; Many more to come soon…\",\r\n        traction: \"Aug 2020 - Having started working on the product in Aug 2020, the first private beta was launched in Dec 2020 to test if the idea even has legs. Within two weeks, we hit a 300+ user mark and the idea of audio stories that help running and achieving a set goal was validated to a certain degree; Jan 2021 - From Dec 2020 to Jan 2021, we continued the private beta and got some validation and feedback while working on the better version of the product. In Jan 2021, we released the open beta version of TELO which is what is still live with some updates; Traction until Oct 2021 (peak numbers): Downloads - 25000+ MAUs - 5100+ WAUs - 1600+ Pivot identified after speaking with users. Although the concept of an Audio-AR driven model to get people excited about running/walking/jogging, it did NOT lead to repeat usage of the product. It was sporadic and it became evident that the vanity of such a product is not long lasting and we needed a stronger value proposition for it to be a household daily used product on our users’ phones. Which is when the repeated mention of fun short events started peaking in user conversations. This is what has lead to the pivot and rebuild of TELO into a platform for small sized events in smaller location circles and giving users the ability to create groups/communities too.\",\r\n        customers: \"Pivoting from a B2C model to a B2B2C model now and hence have only begun building the product, while speaking to some really interesting strategic partnerships with premium sports apparel brands, smartphone brands, property developers/builders who want to be part of the journey, can’t name them as yet as the conversations are still preliminary. Having said that, there is surely interest in this segment. Strategic partnership would be with the brands like Milind Soman and his branded event - Pinkathon. As mentioned in the video, he is ready to be a brand ambassador if the proposition is right.\",\r\n        businessmodel: \"B2B2C model where brands participate in creating fun and engaging experiences around fitness and all of them have to be tracked on the app itself.
