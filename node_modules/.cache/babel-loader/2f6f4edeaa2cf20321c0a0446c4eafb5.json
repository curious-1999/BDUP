The one who gives authority to some trustable person is known as a principal or a donor. There are various situations in one's life where an individual possessing properties, bank accounts, etc. may not be in a position to perform his duties due to reasons like being abroad, physically ill, old in age etc. In such situations, if the transaction requires the presence of the individual who is not able to be present personally, then the only way out is to give the powers to act on behalf of the individual to another person. This is when a Power of Attorney deed is to be created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n </p> <img src={HomeUrl} height=\"15\" className=\"mt-3\" alt=\"\" /> </div> </Col> </Row>\r\n<Row> <Col lg={12}> <div className=\"title-box text-left\"> <h3 className=\"title-heading mt-4\">\r\nDisclaimer\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n</h3> <p className=\"text-muted f-17 mt-3\">\r\nAny transaction in securities that companies may offer or conclude with any other member of the platform shall be offered, issued, allotted or transferred in strict compliance of all applicable laws including but not limited to private placement rules under applicable securities laws.\r\nOur platform has an internal mechanism to restrict the number of Investors that view the detailed profile to 200 by default thereby making it compliant with the applicable laws.
