Users: How many times have we set clear intentions like the following: This year I am going to go to the gym regularly! This year onwards I am going to run regularly! From now on, fitness and eating healthy is going to be my top-most priority only to realize two weeks later (for 92% of us at least) we have fallen back to our old ways. Fitness is 'BORING' and that is one of the largest reasons why most of us drop out of fitness habits. Users are rarely hooked on to the same fitness programs. It is not easy to come up with unique programs for everyone, especially not at a low cost. Brands: Brands have always been looking for ways to engage both internal and external users with campaigns that can put them in the positive mindspace of their users. Health related events have a very positive angle to it, however it has NOT been easy to create, coordinate, market and get reports around these from one single platform.\",\n  solution: \"TELO - an events-based fitness tracking app for all of us!

Within two weeks, we hit a 300+ user mark and the idea of audio stories that help running and achieving a set goal was validated to a certain degree; Jan 2021 - From Dec 2020 to Jan 2021, we continued the private beta and got some validation and feedback while working on the better version of the product. In Jan 2021, we released the open beta version of TELO which is what is still live with some updates; Traction until Oct 2021 (peak numbers): Downloads - 25000+ MAUs - 5100+ WAUs - 1600+ Pivot identified after speaking with users.

Brands would pay TELO to host the events and in exchange they would get the analytics, reporting and additional support in creating fun and engaging audio and visual content that can be placed strategically in the app that could play during the event in the best suitable format - video, audio, reading material etc. A simple example here for a Property Developer Brands create ‘Free’ events - Pay $ for analytics and reports; Brands create ‘Paid’ events - Pay higher $ for analytics, reports and the majority portion of the entry fees paid by users. TELO takes a cut; Brands pay $ for smartly placed advertisements within events wherever feasible and non-intrusive for users; Users pay $ for participating in paid events, TELO earns a cut out of it; B2C model also exists but will be the last focus where users can be incentivised to pay a monthly subscription to be able to participate in a max number of paid events for free and earn points and other goodies provided by brands for their participation; Users can also pay for training modules created by experts and coaches out of which a majority would go to the respective coaches/experts and TELO takes a small cut\",\n  competition: \"TELO would be competing in two areas with two different kinds of entities - Fitness tracking and Events.
