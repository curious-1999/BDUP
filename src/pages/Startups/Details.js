        problem: "Let us all agree on this, Fitness can be BORING! Users: How many times have we set clear intentions like the following: This year I am going to go to the gym regularly! This year onwards I am going to run regularly! From now on, fitness and eating healthy is going to be my top-most priority only to realize two weeks later (for 92% of us at least) we have fallen back to our old ways. Fitness is 'BORING' and that is one of the largest reasons why most of us drop out of fitness habits. Users are rarely hooked on to the same fitness programs. It is not easy to come up with unique programs for everyone, especially not at a low cost. Brands: Brands have always been looking for ways to engage both internal and external users with campaigns that can put them in the positive mindspace of their users. Health related events have a very positive angle to it, however it has NOT been easy to create, coordinate, market and get reports around these from one single platform.",

'Events' however have the ability to keep things light, fun and engaging, especially when there is the possibility of it being a social and community driven phenomenon. Enter TELO, a mobile app where users can discover, register, set-reminders, practice/train, participate/track, share and brag achievements and more importantly - Build a Tribe around their fitness habits! Imagine a day where you have grown fit, but also have built a community around your friends circle, family, school, college, social media or anywhere you find your tribe.

Within two weeks, we hit a 300+ user mark and the idea of audio stories that help running and achieving a set goal was validated to a certain degree; Jan 2021 - From Dec 2020 to Jan 2021, we continued the private beta and got some validation and feedback while working on the better version of the product. In Jan 2021, we released the open beta version of TELO which is what is still live with some updates; Traction until Oct 2021 (peak numbers): Downloads - 25000+ MAUs - 5100+ WAUs - 1600+ Pivot identified after speaking with users. Although the concept of an Audio-AR driven model to get people excited about running/walking/jogging, it did NOT lead to repeat usage of the product. It was sporadic and it became evident that the vanity of such a product is not long lasting and we needed a stronger value proposition for it to be a household daily used product on our users’ phones. Which is when the repeated mention of fun short events started peaking in user conversations. This is what has lead to the pivot and rebuild of TELO into a platform for small sized events in smaller location circles and giving users the ability to create groups/communities too.",
